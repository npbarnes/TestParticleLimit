This repo had tools for simulating an ionospheric barium injection experiment similar to CRRES[^1] or KiNET-X[^2][^3].
It includes simple neutral cloud models and barium photochemical models.

The simulation assumes test particles and small gyroradius limits, so it may not be accurate at small spatial or temporal scales or whenever electrodynamics is important.
However, it is well suited for studying how neutral cloud and photochemical models affect overall ion cloud morphology.

See `plotting_script.jl` for a simple example of usage. The result is below, feel free to compare it with the experimental image of the two KiNET-X releases above.

My PhD dissertation[^3] has a detailed comparison between these test particle simulations, a more sophisticated (but slower) fully electromagnetic simulation, and KiNET-X data.
